# LangGraph AI WebAgent with FastAPI

This project provides a FastAPI-based web service that integrates with LangGraph and various tools to create a conversational AI agent. The agent can dynamically select between different language models and utilize tools like TavilySearchResults for enhanced functionality.

## Features

- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Choose between different language models like `llama3-70b-8192` and `mixtral-8x7b-32768`.
- **Tavily Search Integration**: Utilize the TavilySearchResults tool to fetch and process search results.
- **ReAct Agent**: Leverage the ReAct agent architecture for handling complex interactions and state management.

## Installation

1. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
   ```plaintext
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the FastAPI server, run the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```
The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and you can test the application on 'http://127.0.0.1:8000\docs' by using 'Try it out'.

To run the streamlit application, run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run ui.py
```
